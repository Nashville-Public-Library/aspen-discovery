- Aspen Discovery will already generate several different grouped work display setting templates. These are each designed for a specific type of library and the way those library types typically display their records in searches. The generated templates are academic, consortium, public, elementary school, and upper level school. You can edit any of these templates or create a brand new one.
- To create a new grouped work display settings profile, click 'add new'.
- You can compare the differences between settings profiles by checking the box next to two and clicking 'compare'.
- Whenever you need to edit a grouped work display setting, click 'edit' on the far right.
- To see the changes made on a settings profile, click 'History'
- Inside the grouped work display settings there are many different customizable options!
- If you click the box for 'Apply Number Of Holdings Boost', Aspen will use the number of items/holdings a biblio record has attached when considering the relevancy of the record. If the record has a lot of items/holdings attached, then the record will show higher in searches.
- Search Results
  - Show Search Tools refers to tools patrons have access to like the ability to link to a RSS Feed of their search, Email their search, save the search, and export the search details to an excel.
  - Show Quick Copy when enabled populates a hyperlinked text in the record that says 'Quick Copy View' that generates a popup that lists where all of the items available are located.

  - Underneath 'Optional details to show for a record in search results' choose the details you would like to present in the record details in the search itself.
    - If you want Lexile information displayed in your searches and records, you do need a Lexile subscription.
- Search Facets
  - Within the search facets dropdown you can decide what branches and availability you want patron searches to default to. Additionally, this is where you define the language for those searches. The search facets are seen above search results.
  
  - ![Toggle Labels](/manual/images/Toggle-Labels.png)
  
  - If you do not want one of those search facets to be labeled and displayed above the search results, remove the text within the box underneath the toggle you do not need.
  - The 'Default Toggle' dropdown defines what patron searches will be defaulted to. Many elementary schools will choose to default their toggle to local collection so students are automatically searching their locations items. 
  - You will want to define a facet group and assign the appropriate one to your grouped work display settings. 
    - See the Grouped Work Facets section of the manual for more information on how to configure your grouped work facets.
- Catalog Enrichment
  - Within catalog enrichment you can choose what types of enrichment is available to the patron in their searches. 
- Full Record Display
  - Within 'Full Record Display' you can define what the patron sees once they click into the record. Sometimes libraries will choose to hide things like Staff View, particularly Elementary school libraries, as their patrons do not need to see the full marc record within the record.
  - This is also where you will choose which details to show in the main/top details section of the record
  - To get a full list of options of what can be included in the record display click 'Reset More Details To Default' under Full Record Options. You can choose exactly what lives in the full record and whether that information should be collapsed by default or already opened when the patron clicks into a record. 
- Once you have defined a Grouped Work Display Settings profile that works for your library make sure to check the box next to your library or location to enable these settings for your searches and records.
