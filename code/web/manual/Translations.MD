##Translations

When translations are available, the languages will be shown on the top right of the Aspen Discovery layer and in the drop-down menu on the top right. 

Translation settings are found in the Language and Translation section of the administration menu. You will need to create a code for the language, give it a display name, and choose a facet value. There is an option to display the language to translators only so that it is not available until after translations have been added.

When in translation mode, translators are able to see boxes next to translatable items that correspond to the term and the translated term. Green boxes have already been translated (but can be modified) and red boxes have not been translated yet. Translators can click on those boxes to translate that item.

There is also the ability to import and export translation singularly or in bulk.
