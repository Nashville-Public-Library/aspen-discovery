##ILS Integration

The Aspen Discovery system is able to connect with any ILS system. In the administration menu under ILS Integration, you are able to define how records from your ILS are loaded into Aspen. 

It is important to determine the audience in the ILS Integration menu. You can also customize item types and formats in this menu under Format Information, customize status fields under Status Mappings, Run Full Update to force a fresh MARC extract, and define translation maps.

You are also able to see the indexing log and ILS Integration dashboard through the ILS Integration module.

##Translation Maps

Translation maps often include audience, collection, item type, location, and shelf location. The translation maps are a way to make MARC record information more accessible to patrons by showing more natural language in search results.
