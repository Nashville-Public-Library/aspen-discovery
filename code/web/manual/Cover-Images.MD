##Covers

Cover images are pulled from the Aspen coce server, which loads images from Google books or Amazon, or from Open Library if the cover is not available from the first two sources. Video covers are loaded from OMDB. If you want to use Syndetics as a cover image source, your credentials can be loaded from the Syndetics module.

You are also able to manually upload or reload cover images from the staff view in the record display.
