##Overdrive

Aspen can connect to Overdrive via an API connection, which allows Overdrive to continuously update items in your catalog. Once enabled, you will be able to use the Overdrive facet and view Overdrive checkouts and holds in the patron account. It also allows patrons to have some control over their Overdrive options, including changing their email address or lending periods.

In the Overdrive module, you will be able to edit settings and scope, and view the indexing log and dashboard for Overdrive information.
