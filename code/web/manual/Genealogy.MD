##Genealogy

The genealogy module can be enabled through the system administration modules menu and then enabled through the library system administration menu.

Once genealogy is enabled, you are able to enter any genealogy information through through genaelogy search, at the bottom of the search results (which will initially be blank). Once records are entered, results will appear in the genealogy search or in the Explore More section of the search.
