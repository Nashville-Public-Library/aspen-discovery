#Aspen Discovery 20.15.00 release notes
##Web Builder Functionality
Aspen Discovery 20.15.00 adds the ability to create web content directly within Aspen Discovery.  All content created is responsive so it works well on all devices and created with accessibility in mind so it will work for most users. 
The following types of content can be added:
###Basic Pages
Basic pages are simple pages based on markdown that allow you to easily create simple pages with text and images.  
 
###Custom Pages
Custom pages are more complex pages that use a responsive grid based system to easily create pages containing a combination of text, images, collection spotlights, and more. 

###Custom Forms
Custom forms allow you to create forms for your patrons to fill out.  Results of the form can be emailed to you or viewed within Aspen Discovery. 

###Web Resources
Web Resources allow you to promote specific resources that the library has access to or wants to promote.  Resources can be found in search results or in a categorized list of resources.

###Staff Directory
The staff directory allows you to display a list of staff for the library.
