### Permissions Updates
- Resolved conflicts between overlapping permissions in Aspen by enforcing mutual exclusivity. (DIS-585) (*LS*)
  - Permissions that were previously presented as checkboxes are now shown as dropdowns to allow only one selection.
  - This change prevents roles from being assigned conflicting levels of access for the same functionality.
- Database updates performed to clean up conflicting permissions. (DIS-585) (*LS*)
  - Retains only the broadest applicable permission per group.
  - Ensures backward compatibility for users who previously had multiple overlapping permissions.
  - Example: If a role had both "Administer Library Collection Spotlights" and "Administer All Collection Spotlights", only the broader permission (i.e., "Administer All Collection Spotlights") is retained.
- Renamed the "Administer Side Loads" permission to "Administer All Side Loads" for clarity. (DIS-585) (*LS*)
