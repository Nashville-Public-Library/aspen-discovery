	// *** 08/Oct/09 - Greg Pendlebury

	//   thousands of sessions active are showing no old sessions.
	// What I can't do is reproduce for testing. It might need the
	//   search delete code from 'destroy()' if it is not calling it.
	// *** 09/Oct/09 - Greg Pendlebury
	// Anecdotal testing Today and Yesterday seems to indicate destroy()
	//   is called by the garbage collector and everything is good.
	// Something to keep in mind though.
